# Backdoor in Python with best options. 
My attempt to make a fully functional Backdoor in Python:
have a look at the simple code, I'm looking forward to making it powerful by adding Keylogger features plus some privilage escalation options.
Refer python docs on the module 'sockets' for more understaning.
I tested on windows and it didn't even got detected by Windows defender!
I tested on Ubuntu and other python-understanding distros it worked with limited features.
USAGE:
-Grants a reverse-shell whenever the backdoor.py is executed
-features include: uploading/downloading files...which is awesome!
